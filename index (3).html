        <p>Exploring Causes, Effects, and Solutions</p>

        <h2>I. Introduction: What is Plastic Pollution?</h2>
        <p>Plastic pollution refers to the accumulation of plastic objects and particles (e.g., bottles, bags, and microbeads) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans. Since the 1950s, plastic production has increased, resulting in over 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic being produced globally. Plastic pollution threatens marine ecosystems and can enter the food chain, causing health issues for humans.</p>

    <div id="section-2" class="sub-section">
        <h2>II. Causes and Contributing Factors</h2>
        <p>The primary cause of plastic pollution is the mass production and consumption of single-use plastics. Improper waste management, overuse of plastic packaging, and the inability of plastics to biodegrade all contribute to this growing problem.</p>

    <div id="section-3" class="sub-section">
        <h2>III. Effects on the Environment and Society</h2>
        <p>Plastic debris harms marine life, as animals mistake plastic for food, leading to injury and death. Additionally, microplastics enter human food sources, causing potential health risks. Economically, plastic pollution affects industries like fishing and tourism, costing billions of dollars annually.</p>
